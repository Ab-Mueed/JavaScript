// JavaScript Sets
// A JavaScript Set is a collection of unique values, whether primitive values or object references.
// Each value can only occur once in a Set.
// You can iterate through the elements of a set in insertion order.
// The insertion order corresponds to the order in which each element was inserted into the set by the add() method.
// typeof(Set) = object
