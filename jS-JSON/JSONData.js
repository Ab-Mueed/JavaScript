// JSON DATA - A Name & A Value
// JSON data is written as name/value pairs, just like JavaScript object properties.
// A name/value pair consists of a field name (in double quotes), followed by a colon, followed by a value.
// JSON names require double quotes. JavaScript names do not.

// "Name":"Value" ["firstName":"Ahmed"]
