// JSON ARRAYS
// JSON arrays are written inside square brackets.
// Just like in JavaScript, an array can contain objects.

/*
"employees":[
  {"firstName":"John", "lastName":"Doe"},
  {"firstName":"Anna", "lastName":"Smith"},
  {"firstName":"Peter", "lastName":"Jones"}
]
*/

// In the example above, the object "employees" is an array. It contains three objects.
// Each object is a record of a person (with a first name and a last name).
