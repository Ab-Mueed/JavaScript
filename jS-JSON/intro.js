// JavaScript JSON
// JSON is a format for storing and transporting data.
// JSON is often used when data is sent from a server to a web page.
// JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation.
// JSON is a lightweight data interchange format.
/*
> JSON is language independent
> The JSON syntax is derived from JavaScript object notation syntax, but the JSON format is text only. Code for reading and
generating JSON data can be written in any programming language.
*/
// JSON is 'self-describing' and easy to understand.

// ---JSON Example---
/*
{
    "employees": [
        {"firstName":"Cristiano", "lastName":"Ronaldo"}
        {"firstName":"Ahmed", "lastName":"Habibi"}
        {"firstName":"Zaid", "lastName":"Habibi"}
    ]
}
