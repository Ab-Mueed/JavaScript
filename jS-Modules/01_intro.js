// JavaScript Modules
// Modules allow you to break up your code into separate files.
// This makes it easier to maintain a code-base.
// Modules only work with the HTTP(s) protocol.


// ------ IMPORT ------
/* 
> Modules are imported from external files with the 'import' statement.
> Modules also rely on type="module" in the <script> tag.
> You can import modules into a file in two ways, based on if they are 'named' exports or 'default' exports.
> [Import from named Exports -> import {variable1, variable2} from ".js file Path"; ]
> [Import from default Exports -> import function from ".js file Path";]

> Syntax:
<script type="module">
import message from "./message.js";
</script>
*/


// ------ EXPORT ------
/*
> Modules with functions or variables can be stored in any external file.
> There are two types of exports: Named Exports and Default Exports.
    > NAMED EXPORT:
        > You can create named exports two ways. In-line individually, or all at once at the bottom.
    > DEFAULT EXPORT
        > You can only have one default export in a file.
> For Better Understanding of EXPORT, check 'EXPORT' directory.
