// JavaScript While Loop
// The while loop loops through a block of code as long as a specified condition is true.
// Syntax
/*
while (condition){
    // code block to be executed
    variable++
}
If you forget to increase the variable used in the condition, the loop will never end. This will crash your browser.

// Example 1
let i = 0;
while (i < 10) {
    console.log(i);
    i++;
}
// 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
