// JavaScript Numbers
// JavaScript Numbers are Always 64-bit Floating Point.
/*
This format stores numbers in 64 bits, where the number (the fraction) is stored in bits 0 to 51, 
the exponent in bits 52 to 62, and the sign in bit 63.
*/
// JavaScript does not define different types of numbers, like integers, short, long, floating-point etc.
// Numbers can be written with or without decimals.
// JavaScript numbers are always stored as double precision floating point numbers, following the international IEEE 754 standard.
