// Conditional Statements
// Conditional statements are used to perform different actions based on different conditions.
// In JavaScript we have the following conditional statements:
/*
1) Use if to specify a block of code to be executed, if a specified condition is true
2) Use else to specify a block of code to be executed, if the same condition is false
3) Use else if to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false
4) Use switch to specify many alternative blocks of code to be executed
