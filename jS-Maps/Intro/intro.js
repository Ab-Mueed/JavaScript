// JavaScript Maps
// A Map holds key-value pairs where the keys can be any datatype.
// Any value (both objects and primitive values) may be used as either a key or a value.
// A Map remembers the original insertion order of the keys.
// A key in the Map may only occur once; it is unique in the Map's collection.
// Iteration happens in insertion order, which corresponds to the order in which each key-value pair was first inserted into the map.
